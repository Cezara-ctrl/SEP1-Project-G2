                The Vellcity Indoor Athletics Club, now often simply referred to as VIAClub, was founded almost a hundred years ago by legendary athlete Robert Sixpack, as a place for the locals to participate in various indoor sport activities. However, rather contradictory to the name, the club has consisted exclusively of an outdoor football team for the last 57 years. While not a big club, it's quite well known, especially for its loyal and very dedicated fans, and has historically been relatively successful.            </p>
